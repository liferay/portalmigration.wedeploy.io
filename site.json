Replacing it with document.querySelector or document.querySelectorAll we lose all that methods. How to migrate: Replace AUI.$(selector) with document.querySelector(selector) if expected result is one node. Replace AUI.$(selector) with document.querySelectorAll(selector) if expected result is more than one node. In this case you will have to iterate over the array to execute methods on each node if needed. Migrate methods: Some methods can't be directly replaced with native implementations so we may need to use some utilities from metal like metal-dom. To do it we need to import the module in the jsp in the following way. let dom = metalDomSrcDom.default; ... let domData = metalDomSrcDomData.default; ...
